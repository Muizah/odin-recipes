    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A pancake also known as a hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack.</p>
    <p>
      It is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based
      batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface
      such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a
      type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were
      probably eaten in prehistoric societies.
